 * 1. WAP to check whether the number contains 3 digit or not

 * 3. WAP to check whether the character is a number or upper case
 * or lower case or special character
 * 
 * 4. WAP to display msg based on criteria
 * a. if number is divisible by 5 -> BUZZ
 * b. if number is divisible by 3 -> FIZZ
 * c. if number is divisible by 3 and 5 both -> FIZZBUZZ
 * d. if number is not divisible by 3 and 5 both -> number
